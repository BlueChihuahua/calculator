# Calculator
This is a javascript based simple calculator.

This calculator performs basic math functions typically found on simple calculators.

It has a maximum view of 12 digits and will not allow inputs larger than the display.
The calculator will also shorten answers to fit the display to 11 digits maximum to compensate
for the additional length of negative numbers.

Multiple calculations are permitted in order, however the calculations will be performed
strictly in the order entered without regards to mathematical order of operations.
